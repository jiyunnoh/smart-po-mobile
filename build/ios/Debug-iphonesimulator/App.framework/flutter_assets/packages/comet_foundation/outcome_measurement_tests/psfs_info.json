  "instructions": "The patient is asked to identify up to three activities that they are unable to do or are having difficulty with as a result of their condition. The patient then scores each activity on the ability to perform. The average of the three activity scores is used to represent the patientâ€™s overall functional outcome. Please ask your patient to identify three activities and score each activity on a 0 to 10 scale where 0 represents unable to perform activity and 10 represents able to perform activity at the same level as before injury or problem.",
