It consists of three scored sections: the psychosocial adjustment section which consists of three subscales (general adjustment, social adjustment, and adjustment to limitation), the activity restriction section, and the satisfaction with the prosthesis section which consists of two subscales (aesthetic and functional satisfaction). A fourth, unscored section assesses pain.",
