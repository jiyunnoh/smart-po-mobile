  "equipment": "A standard armchair (approximately 46 cm in height) and a clear walkway with a mark at 3 meters.",
  "instructions": "Begin by having the patient sit with their back against the chair and their hands on the arms of the chair. Any assistive device to be used should be within reach of the patient. On the command \"go\", have the patient rise from the chair, walk 3 meters at a comfortable and safe pace, turn around and walk back to the chair, and sit down. Timing begins at the instruction to \"go\" and ends when the patient's buttocks touch the seat. One practice trial should be permitted. Any assistive device used should be kept constant between tests if the results are to be compared.",
  "mcid_mdc": "MCID = Minimally Clinically Important Difference, MDC = Minimal Detectable Change\n\nAlzheimer's Disease: MDC = 4.09s\nStroke: MDC = 2.9s\nParkinson's Disease: MDC = 3.5s\nSpinal Cord Injury: MDC= 10.8s\n\nThese are published values for specific populations and provide guidance if the patient does not have the listed condition.",
  "overview": "The Timed Up & Go (TUG) Test is a performance measure used to assess a patient's ability to stand, walk, turn, and sit. It can be employed to assess mobility, balance, walking ability, and fall risk.",
  "population": "The intended population includes the following conditions:  Geriatrics, Hip Fracture, Parkinson's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer's, Stroke, Knee and Hip Arthroplasty, and Huntington's Disease.",
