The time for each trial is started when the first foot makes contact with Square 2 and is stopped when the last foot makes contact with Square 1. Repeat the trial if the patient is unsuccesful at completing the sequence, loses balance, or contacts a cane (or rod) during the trial. A score is still provided if the patient is unable to face forward during the entire sequence. \n\nInstructions given to patient: \"Try to complete the sequence as fast as possible without touching the sticks. Both feet must make contact with the floor in each square. If possible, face forward during the entire sequence.\"",
