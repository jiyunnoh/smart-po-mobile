If an activity is limited by something other than their foot or ankle, the patient is asked to record N/A. Questions for which N/A is indicated are not counted. \n\nFAAM ADL Score = [(sum of n responses)/4n] x 100, where n is equal to the number of completed responses. A FAAM ADL score may not be calculated if there is greater than one missing item. \n\nFAAM Sports Score = [(sum of n responses)/4n] x 100, where n is equal to the number of completed responses.
