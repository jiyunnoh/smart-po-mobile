  "overview": "The Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) is a self-report measure that is used to evaluate the impairment of a patient with lower extremity musculoskeletal conditions or disorders. This tool can be used clinically to measure the initial function, ongoing progress, and outcome in the following areas: activities of daily living, balance, coordination, functional mobility, life participation, occupational performance, quality of life, range of motion, and strength.",
  "population": "The intended population includes the following conditions:  Musculoskeletal Conditions of the Lower Extremities, Stroke, and Chronic Pain.",
