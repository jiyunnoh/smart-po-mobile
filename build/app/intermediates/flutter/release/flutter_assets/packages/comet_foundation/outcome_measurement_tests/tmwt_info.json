  "instructions": "Normal comfortable speed: Have the patient start at the 0-meter mark. Instruct the patient \"I will say ready, set, go. When I say go, walk at your normal comfortable speed until I say stop.\"\n\nMaximum speed trials: Have the patient start at the 0-meter mark. \"I will say ready, set, go. When I say go, walk as fast as you safely can until I say stop.\"\n\nIt is suggested to time your patient for a walking distance of 6 m. The time is started when any part of the leading foot crosses the plane of the 2-meter mark. The time is stopped when any part of the leading foot crosses the plane of the 8-meter mark. Document the actual distance timed as 6 m.\n\nIf you choose to time your patient for a walking distance of 8 m or 10 m, document the actual distance timed accordingly and start/stop the time when any part of the leading foot crosses the plane of the marks for the correct distance. \n\nDocument the level of assistance required and the type of assistive device and/or bracing used. If a patient requires total assistance or is unable to ambulate, a score of 0 m/s will be documented.\n\nThe level of physical assistance is to be documented using the ordinal 7-point scale: \n1 = total assistance [0-24% of task performed]\n2 = maximum assistance [25-49% of task performed]\n3 = moderate assistance [50-74% of task performed]\n4 = minimum assistance [75-99% of task performed]\n5 = supervision [required stand-by or set-up assistance; no physical contact provided]\n6 = modified independent [assistive device or bracing used, extra time needed, mild safety issues]\n7 = independent",
