  "overview": "The Upper Extremity Functional Index (UEFI) is a patient-reported outcome measure used to assess the functional impairment in individuals with upper limb musculoskeletal conditions or disorders. The UEFI consists of 20 questions on a 5-point rating scale assessing level of difficulty in performing activities of daily living using the upper extremities including household and work activities, hobbies, lifting a bag of groceries, washing the scalp, pushing up on the hands, driving, etc.",
  "population": "The intended population includes the following conditions:  Musculoskeletal Conditions of the Upper Extremities, Stroke, Breast Cancer Surgery, and Chronic Pain.",

All items must be answered for a UEFI score to be calculated.",
